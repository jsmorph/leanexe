# Detailed Plans

The root [Development Plan](../plan.md) is the only active work queue.  This directory contains a detailed technical plan when an unfinished item needs more design than the root queue should carry.  Completed implementation plans and experiment sequences are removed after their current facts enter reference documentation and their remaining tasks enter the root plan.

| Plan | Status | Scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| [Source-Theorem Transport](theorem-transport.md) | Deferred pending smaller compiler-theorem experiments | Connect a Lean source theorem through proof-grade IR semantics and verified lowering to a theorem about exact artifact bytes. |

The active near-term compiler-theorem work appears in phase 3 of the root plan.  [Compiler Architecture](../docs/compiler.md) defines the current implemented theorem boundary, while [Artifact Proving](../docs/artifact-proving.md) defines the independent final theorem.  Any future detailed plan must identify the root-plan item it expands and disappear when that item completes or becomes obsolete.
