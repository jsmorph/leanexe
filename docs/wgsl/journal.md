## 2026-09-16 — Profile foundation and first generator

Started from the plan-only `wgsl` branch. Split work into generation, native
execution, and profile/proof integration, with all Lean verification serialized
by the root agent through `tools/leanrun`. The first kernel uses independent
output invocations rather than introducing shared memory or barriers before a
simple artifact can be checked.

The checkout had no Lean installation or dependency cache. Downloaded the pinned
Lean 4.34.0-rc2 Linux release into ignored `build/tools/lean`; checked the GitHub
release SHA-256 `3d011041203acacf300d343a39673f7d233743397993797c941346ae9e5df1a8`.
Sandbox access to the systemd user bus failed, but the approved runner outside
the sandbox established the required scope. Local mode was not used. The runner
reported exact Lean commit `6a10ac8c22beadecabdbb0919c2b50214762f91d`.

Lean checked the profile refinement, evaluation inclusion, nonempty evaluation,
and theorem-composition modules. The generator's first build reported a record
layout syntax error; expanding the record fields fixed it. Generation tests then
passed, including rectangular indexing, partial workgroups, zero/oversize
dimensions, invalid bindings, excessive workgroups, and dispatch overflow.

These are ordinary handwritten Lean proofs with no agent proof-generation or LTG
retrieval run yet. No accepted artifact theorem or independent artifact package
verification is claimed. The useful shared abstractions so far are operation
choices separate from fusion, and total execution obligations separate from
universal output predicates. The scalar interpretation remains an explicit hole
in the development, not a hidden assumption presented as a theorem.

Read the pinned WGSL floating-point rules before choosing the candidate runtime
profiles. The existing Talos dependency already has a pure integer `IEEE32`
model and binary32 error lemmas; this is a better reuse candidate than a new
parallel arithmetic implementation. Its source remains in the dependency.
