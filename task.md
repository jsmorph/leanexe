# Scalar compiler correctness: restarted, INCOMPLETE

## Correction and authorization

The prior completion reports were false. They covered a separate backend and
five manually supplied source/IR certificates. They did not establish a usable
certified Lean-source compiler. The user has explicitly instructed removal of
that implementation and completion of the actual job. Those changes are removed
from the working tree; Git history preserves what happened. Work remains on
`correct`, with the reviewed `typesafety` source restored from
834ba204d84720e00deef9b4ce476d4a04e55ff4. Main and typesafety are untouched.

Do not mark this agenda complete because examples or backend proofs pass.
Completion requires the source-declaration compiler interface below.

## Required result

A command accepts a checked Lean module and entry declaration in the supported
scalar subset. It invokes the existing LeanExe extraction/compiler path, emits
WASM, and produces a kernel-checked theorem connecting that original declaration
to those exact bytes for every input. The user supplies no handwritten IR,
source-correspondence certificate, or compiler-correctness proof per program.
An untrusted proof-producing frontend is acceptable only when all its output is
independently checked. A pilot registry is not a frontend.

The profile uses concrete WASM values: UInt64 arguments/results, internal Bool,
modular arithmetic, unsigned comparisons, bit operations and masked shifts,
strict bindings, branches, acyclic scalar helper calls, and supported terminating
structured iteration. Division by zero returns zero and remainder by zero the
dividend. Runtime Nat, heap objects, imports, mutable globals, and allocation are
excluded. Proof-level Nat and explicit termination arguments are permitted.

## Completion gates

- [ ] Read and identify the actual existing extraction, IR, lowering, and emission paths.
- [ ] Define independent scalar semantics and precise source/ABI/termination contracts.
- [ ] Implement source-only certified entry admission with explicit errors.
- [ ] Automatically establish original-Lean-declaration to actual extracted-IR correspondence.
- [ ] Prove or automatically certify every accepted scalar lowering pass.
- [ ] Cover strict bindings, branching, numeric boundaries, and acyclic helper calls.
- [ ] Cover the agreed structured-loop/termination cases without per-program WASM proofs.
- [ ] Use actual compiler emission and prove full decoded-module equality for exact bytes.
- [ ] Produce portable proof packages independently checkable without compiler/generator execution.
- [ ] Compile and certify unseen source functions with no registration, handwritten IR, or correctness certificates.
- [ ] Check deliberate source/extractor/IR/opcode/call/export/ABI/manifest mutations.
- [ ] Audit final theorem dependencies: no holes, fresh axioms, or native-evaluation shortcuts.
- [ ] Preserve the independent TypeSafety propext-only policy.
- [ ] Pass a clean-checkout gate starting from source declarations and a separate package-only gate.
- [ ] Update documentation with actual scope, exact commands, limitations, and remaining obligations.

## Work policy

Commit and push frequently; explicitly announce every successful push. Keep Lean
processes serial under the pinned toolchain. The user explicitly authorized direct
local Lean execution; tools/leanrun with LEANRUN_LOCAL=1 retains locking and
bounded execution. Split a timed-out diagnostic before retrying it. Do not spawn
other agents without authorization. No status statement can exceed its evidence.

## Journal

### Restart

Inspected the real path: LeanExe.Extract.compileEnvironment uses the existing
extractor to produce LeanExe.IR.Module; LeanExe.Wasm.Binary.CoreWasm emits it.
ScalarDescriptor and ScalarCertificate already connect parts of actual lowering
to reusable descriptor code. The typesafety base also contains the Talos
ScalarTransition proof library. The previous separate Correct/Scalar64 path,
manual-certificate CLI, bundled pilot packages, and false completion report have
been removed. The required source-only frontend is currently UNIMPLEMENTED.
